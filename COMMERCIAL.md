## Philosophy

I believe in **fair compensation for value created**. If you're making money using my work, I should benefit too. But I'm flexible and creative about deal structures.

**I prefer:**
- Long-term partnerships over one-off deals
- Revenue sharing over large upfront payments (shows confidence)
- Collaboration over arm's-length licensing
- Win-win scenarios over zero-sum negotiations

## Legal

All commercial agreements include:
- Written contract with clear terms
- Payment schedule and reporting requirements
- IP ownership clarification
- Termination clauses
- Dispute resolution mechanism
